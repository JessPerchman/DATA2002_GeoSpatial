# Livability Analysis

## Assignment Rubric

This was a collaborative assignment between myself, Jesse Morris and Athena Kam. In this assignment, we were tasked to gather and integrate several datasets in order to investigate the most ‘liveable’
suburb for a potential stakeholder to buy in Greater Sydney through calculation of a ‘liveability’ score, our stakeholder in this scenario being an elderly citizen who had several accessibility needs.
